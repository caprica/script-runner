# script-runner

What?
-----

A simple SQL script runner.

This is currently very rough and ready and was hacked up in about an hour.

Create a script runner component, add an event listener (use the default or provide your own), then execute the script.
That's it.

Improvements will likely come, over time...

Why?
----

I needed something quick to execute SQL scripts in an automated way, with decent nicely formatted output and error
reporting.
